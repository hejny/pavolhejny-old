        .about
            p I am a developer and technology enthusiast from Prague. I ❤️ new technologies. Especially technologies on the web (<a href="/virtualni-realita-na-webu-2018-11-14">like WebVR</a>).

            p I speak at tech conferences (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7gQtatWSKc">LinuxDays about BrowserAPIs</a>) and organize tech/startup communities (e.g. <a href="https://www.mozilla.cz/">Mozilla.cz</a>, <a href="http://communities.techstars.com/czech-republic/prague/startup-weekend/">StartupWeekend Prague</a>, <a href="https://www.itnetwork.cz/">ITNetwork</a>.

            p I am currently working on <a href="https://www.h-edu.cz/">math textbooks</a> and also I have <a href="https://github.com/hejny/">few own projects</a>. I was a former employee of <a href="https://www.birdlife.cz/">Czech Society for Ornithology</a> where I was creating apps for citizen science.

        //I am very interested in new technologies and how we can move the world forward with them. I think we should join the right people, ideas, technologies, and money together to create something BIG. And hackathons are a great opportunity to do it quickly and do not waste the time.
