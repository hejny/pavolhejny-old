Another Startup Weekend - this time I did not participate as a competitor, but as an organizer/mentor. And it was awesome!

---

Long time I don't think that I will participate in this event because it was only for students.
When <person>Max<!--Kozlov--></person> mentioned to me that he will be at next Startup Weekend in Pilsen I knew that I should be there too. I have written <person>Pavel Koenig<role>main organizer</role></person> and we have
agreed that I will be there as org.
