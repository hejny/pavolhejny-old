# Security talks Pilsen

<!--date:2018-06-12-->

When I was at the Startup Weekend Pilsen I didn`t know that I will be back in Pilsen in a month at the security/crypto event organized by [![TechHeaven logo](/images/logos/techheaven-icon.svg) TechHeaven](https://techheaven.org/).

The whole event was held in beautifull place DEPO2015.

There were 3 talks:

## Security issues in web apps

Vladimír Smitka shows interesting security mistakes eg. vulnerabilities when using <code>target="\_blank"</code>. He continues with problems of uploading, keeping debugger, keeping backup files from Vim and .git directory accessible from the network and CSRF.

It was very similar as my talk 2 months ago at ITNetwork meetup. I have written article<flag-cs/> about it.

## Cryptography

Pavel Škoda showed the history of cryptography and differences between symmetric vs. asymmetric ciphers.

## IT (in)security

Jiří Vaněk told interesting cases of critical vulnerabilities in history, stories from penetration testing and how to do it better.

After that, there was a networking. I met there one of my friends from Startup Weekend Pilsen xxxx Žahour who is [creating hydrogen car]() and lot of other cool projects in hardware.


I have stayed at beautifull coworking space [![TechHeaven logo](/images/logos/techheaven-icon.svg) TechHeaven](https://techheaven.org/). And next day Jan Steinbach (main organizer of thes event and CEO of [![TechHeaven logo](/images/logos/techheaven-icon.svg) TechHeaven](https://techheaven.org/)) planned next events and hackathons. So I am looking forward to next cool events in Pilsen!
