# Security talks Pilsen

<!--date:2018-06-12-->

When I was at the Startup Weekend Pilsen I didn`t know that I will be back in Pilsen in a month at the security/crypto event organized by [![TechHeaven logo](/images/logos/techheaven-icon.svg) TechHeaven](https://techheaven.org/).

The whole event was held in 

There were 3 talks:

## Security issues in web apps

Vladimír Smitka shows interesting security mistakes eg. vulnerabilities when using target="\_blank". He continues with problems of uploading, keeping debugger on and keeping backup files from Vim and .git directory accessible from the network.

## Cryptography

Pavel Škoda showed the history of cryptography and differences between symmetric vs. asymmetric ciphers.

## IT (in)security

Jiří Vaněk told interesting cases of critical vulnerabilities in history, stories from penetration testing and how to do it better.
