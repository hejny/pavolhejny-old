# Security talks Pilsen

<!--date:2018-06-12-->

When I was at the [Startup Weekend Pilsen](/startup-weekend-pilsen-2018) I didn't know that I will be back in Pilsen in a month at the security/crypto event organized by <place>TechHeaven</place>. The whole event was held in beautiful place <place>DEPO2015</place>.

<!--todo featured-->

There were 3 talks:

## Security issues in web apps

<person>Vladimír Smitka</person> shows interesting security mistakes eg. vulnerabilities when using <code>target="\_blank"</code>. He continues with problems of uploading, keeping debugger, keeping backup files from Vim and .git directory accessible from the network and CSRF.

It was very similar to my talk 2 months ago at ITNetwork meetup. I have written [an article<flag-cs/>](https://www.itnetwork.cz/php/bezpecnost/jak-si-nechat-hacknout-webovou-aplikaci) about it.

## Cryptography

<person>Pavel Škoda</person> showed the history of cryptography and differences between symmetric vs. asymmetric ciphers.

After that, there was a networking. I met there one of my friends from [Startup Weekend Pilsen](/startup-weekend-pilsen-2018) <person>David Žahour</person> who is [creating hydrogen car<flag-cs/>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPE3o9neP0M) and a lot of other cool projects in hardware with his group [iSOUEsense - IoT](https://www.facebook.com/isouesense/).

I have stayed at beautiful coworking space <place>TechHeaven</place>. And next day <person source="Jan Steinbach">Honza<role>main organizer of this event and CEO of <place>TechHeaven</place></role></person> and me planned next events and hackathons. So I am looking forward to next cool events in Pilsen!
